DartConfiguration.tcl in cmake-build directory has options concerning the build.

In particular for valgrind there is a
ValgrindCommandOptions: --track-origins=yes

but maybe I should use instead...
MemoryCheckCommandOptions:  --track-origins=yes

Which classes use or depend on SpatialIndex? We need to be concerned about default SpatialIndexes showing up.

RangeConvex.h:
const SpatialIndex * index_;    // A pointer to the index

An index is passed into RangeConvex, which then uses it for intersections etc. 

SpatialDomain.h:
const SpatialIndex *index;            /// A pointer to the index

SpatialEdge.h:
SpatialIndex & tree_;

SpatialInterface.h:
SpatialIndex *index_;

STARE.h:
SpatialIndex    sIndex;

Can we remove intervals from a range?

** Be very careful when calling HTM library from STARE, particularly when the HTM code makes SpatialIndexes. The legacy SpatialIndex default constructor is different from the SpatialIndex created by STARE.
