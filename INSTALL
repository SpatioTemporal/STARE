#
# CMake build 
#
# Out-of-source build. Assume ./STARE is the TOPDIR.
# 
# Products:
#   libSTARE.a and PySTARE.so (if built) will be in build/default/src
#   tests will be in build/default/tests
#   ./STARE/include contains the headers
#

# The default location for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is /usr/local (UNIX)
#	or c:/Program Files (Windows). Running the below cmake command will
#	set it to $prefix/deps. If you wish to install it elsewhere, simply
#	set the environment variable to your preferred location.

# The PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS environment variable can be set to the locations
# of python and numpy/core include directories. See src/CMakeLists.txt for
# how the include_directories is set.

mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make

# To make a source distribution after running cmake...

make dist

# To install the include files and library, try the following.

mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=< install_path > .. 
make test
make install

# Optimization flags may be set via an environment variable OPTFLAGS or via
# the cmake invocation as
cmake -DOPTFLAGS="-O2"
# Note the default is set to "-O3".

###########################################################################
#
# Testing - Simple
#
# To run tests, after making the library as above, try the following
# in the build directory.

make test

###########################################################################
#
# Testing - ctest
#
# CMake provides a useful framework for testing.
#
# To run tests, after making the library as above, try the following
# in the build directory.

ctest

# For performing Valgrind-based memory tests, rerun cmake and test as follows.
cmake -DOPTFLAGS="-O0" ../STARE
make
ctest -T memcheck
# which will produce a number of logs and analyses of the memory integrity.
