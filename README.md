# ENCODING HIGHLIGHTS

## SPATIAL

The spatial encoding encodes the traversal through a recursive partitioning
(quadfurcation) of spherical triangles to find points located on the unit sphere.

STARE API's expects input latitudes and longitudes to be compatible with WGS84, i.e. geocentric.

| BITS | USAGE                                                                         |
|:----:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|63 - 62  |Not used									     |
|59 - 61  |Root octahedron index							     |
| 5 - 58  |Tree traversal (2 bits to partition each triangle, 27 levels of partitions)    |
| 0 -  4  |Resolution indicator, also Terminator indicator if all bits are set            |

See src/EmbeddedLevelNameEncoding.C, EmbeddedLevelNameEncoding::getSciDBLeftJustifiedFormat.

## TEMPORAL

The temporal encoding assigns fields of bits to encode calendrical values, e.g.
year, month, day, etc., in a 64-bit Hierarchical Calendrical Encoding (HCE). Temporal
resolution and encoding type information is also included. A signed 64-bit integer (int64_t)
is used for the array index values generated by the library.

The recommended way to set the STARE temporal index is via
International Atomic Time (TAI) or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). STARE
uses the Essential Routines for Fundamental Astronomy (ERFA) translation of
the International Astronomical Union's Standards of Fundamental Astronomy
(IAU/SOFA), http://www.iausofa.org/. ERFA is found at https://github.com/liberfa/erfa.

Internally, STARE uses ERFA to translate UTC to TAI, and constructs the
native temporal array index values using TAI. ERFA does not follow the BCE/CE
distinction for calendar years, i.e. for ERFA there is a year zero. The STARE API calls
for UTC and TAI follow this ERFA convention.

The native fields can be set directly, in which case the user
assumes responsibility for the correctness of the date encoded.

The default partitioning of an HCE word follows. See TemporalIndex for more information.

| BITS |  WIDTH |  USAGE |
|:-----:|:--------:|:--------|
|63      |     | Set by the sign (2-s complement), also called the Before/After bit|
|50 - 62 | 13  | Year (0..\*)|
|46 - 49 |  4  | Month (0..13)|
|44 - 45 |  2  | Week (0..4)|
|41 - 43 |  3  | Day (0..7)|
|36 - 40 |  5  | Hour (0..23)|
|30 - 35 |  6  | Minute (0..59)|
|24 - 29 |  6  | Second (0..59)|
|14 - 23 | 10  | Millisecond (0..999)|
| 8 - 13 |  6  | Forward Resolution indicates a time scale associated with a bit position\*\*|
| 2 -  7 |  6  | Reverse Resolution indicates a time scale associated with a bit position\*\*|
| 0 -  1 |  2  | Type indicator (default = 2)|

\*The default STARE temporal index can range between year -262143 and 262143 in the
   internal native format. Year zero and negative years are set by setting
   a *positive* number in the year field and setting the Before/After bit to 0.
   Year=0 and Before/After=1 is an error. See TemporalIndex for more detail.

\*\*A resolution of zero corresponds to the coarsest bit, e.g. the top of the
   year field (bit position 62). A resolution of 54 corresponds to the finest
   resolution, 1 ms (bit position 8). These are for the default encoding,
   type = 1. Forward and reverse resolution indicate direction in time
   away from encoded temporal position.

# HISTORY

2018-2021 Development supported by NASA/ACCESS-17.

The spatial indexing is a fork of version 2 of the Hierarchical Triangular Mesh (HTM) developed for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

HTM Version 2 is the legacy version: http://www.skyserver.org/HTM/Old_default.aspx

Seminal work on the HTM for indexing the sphere was done by P.Z. Kunszt, A.S. Szalay, I. Csabai, A.R. Thakar, with extended development by J. Gray and G. Fekete (http://www.skyserver.org/HTM/doc/).  See also Kondor et al., 2014, "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0709.pdf".
